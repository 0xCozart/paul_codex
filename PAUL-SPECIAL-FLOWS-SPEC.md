# PAUL Enhancement: Specialized Workflow Integration

**Date:** 2026-01-29
**Status:** Approved Design, Ready for Implementation
**Context:** Discussion from Extendly RevOps project session

---

## Problem Statement

Users have specialized skills, commands, and workflows (e.g., `/revops-expert`, `/frontend-design`, `/site-launcher-wp`) that should be explicitly integrated into PAUL governance. Currently, these are invoked ad-hoc without:
- Documentation of when they're required
- Verification that they were actually used
- Gap analysis for continuous improvement

## Solution: Layered Skill Reinforcement

```
PROJECT.md / SPECIAL-FLOWS.md   →  "This project uses X, Y, Z skills"
         ↓
ROADMAP.md                      →  "Phase 1 requires X skill"
         ↓
PLAN.md                         →  "Task 1.1 calls /frontend-design"
         ↓
UNIFY verification              →  "Was skill invoked? Gap noted if not"
```

## Architecture

### File Structure

```
~/.claude/paul-framework/
├── references/
│   └── specialized-workflow-integration.md   # Concept documentation
├── templates/
│   └── SPECIAL-FLOWS.template.md             # Fillable structure
├── workflows/
│   └── configure-special-flows.md            # Process logic
└── commands/
    └── flows.md                              # /paul:flows skill

.paul/                                        # Per-project output
└── SPECIAL-FLOWS.md                          # Generated artifact
```

### Separation of Concerns

| Component | Responsibility | Location |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| **Reference** | Explains *why* and *what* - philosophy, examples | `references/` |
| **Template** | Defines *structure* - sections, tables, fields | `templates/` |
| **Workflow** | Executes *how* - prompts user, generates output | `workflows/` |
| **Command** | Provides *access* - ad-hoc entry, calls workflow | `commands/` |
| **Init** | *Orchestrates* - surfaces question, routes if yes | `workflows/init-project.md` |

---

## Component Specifications

### 1. Reference: `specialized-workflow-integration.md`

**Purpose:** Conceptual documentation explaining the overall approach.

**Contents:**
- Why explicit skill integration matters
- How skills flow through PLAN → APPLY → UNIFY
- Examples of skill types (commands, workflows, templates, external tools)
- Gap analysis philosophy
- Evolution: how patterns improve over time

### 2. Template: `SPECIAL-FLOWS.template.md`

```markdown
# Specialized Flows

## Project-Level Dependencies

| Work Type | Skill/Command | When Required | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| [type] | [/skill-name] | [trigger condition] | [optional] |

## Phase Overrides

| Phase | Additional Skills | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| [N] | [/skill:subcommand] | [why needed for this phase] |

## Templates & Assets

| Asset Type | Location | When Used |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| [HTML template] | [path] | [trigger] |

## Verification Checklist

During UNIFY, confirm:
- [ ] Listed skills were invoked
- [ ] Gaps documented in STATE.md Deviations
- [ ] Patterns updated if intentional deviation

---
*Generated by /paul:flows or paul:init*
*Last updated: [timestamp]*
```

### 3. Workflow: `configure-special-flows.md`

**Trigger:** Called by `init-project.md` or `/paul:flows` command

**Process:**
```xml
<step name="discover_available_skills">
1. Scan .claude/commands/ for available skills
2. Present categorized list to user
3. Ask: "Which skills apply to this project?"
</step>

<step name="map_skills_to_work_types">
For each selected skill:
1. Ask: "What type of work triggers this skill?"
2. Ask: "Any phase-specific overrides?"
3. Populate template sections
</step>

<step name="identify_templates_assets">
1. Ask: "Do you have reference templates or assets?"
2. If yes: capture paths and trigger conditions
</step>

<step name="generate_output">
1. Create .paul/SPECIAL-FLOWS.md from template
2. Update PROJECT.md with reference to SPECIAL-FLOWS.md
3. Confirm with user
</step>
```

**Output:** `.paul/SPECIAL-FLOWS.md` created and linked

### 4. Command: `flows.md` → `/paul:flows`

```markdown
<command-name>paul:flows</command-name>

<purpose>
Create, amend, or audit specialized workflow integrations for a PAUL project.
</purpose>

<subcommands>
/paul:flows           # Create or edit SPECIAL-FLOWS.md (interactive)
/paul:flows add       # Add single skill mapping
/paul:flows audit     # Check current phase against declared flows
/paul:flows list      # Show current mappings
</subcommands>

<execution>
@~/.claude/paul-framework/workflows/configure-special-flows.md
</execution>
```

### 5. Init Integration (Lean)

**Update to `init-project.md`:**

```xml
<step name="check_specialized_flows" priority="after_roadmap">
Ask: "Do you have specialized skills, commands, or workflows for this project?"

Options:
- Yes → Route to: @workflows/configure-special-flows.md
- No  → Skip, note: "Add later via /paul:flows"
- Later → Flag in PROJECT.md for future configuration
</step>
```

**Key Principle:** Init stays lean as orchestrator. Does NOT contain workflow logic.

## Integration with Existing PAUL Artifacts

### PROJECT.md Addition

```markdown
## Specialized Flows

See: .paul/SPECIAL-FLOWS.md

Quick Reference:
- /revops-expert → Persuasion copy, offers, CTAs
- /frontend-design → UI components, HTML generation
```

### ROADMAP.md Phase Annotations

```markdown
### Phase 1: Registration Flow
**Required Skills:** /revops-expert (copy), /frontend-design (UI)
**Templates:** templates/registration-hero.html
```

### PLAN.md Task Dependencies

```markdown
## Pre-Implementation
- [ ] Load /revops-expert (Hormozi frameworks)
- [ ] Reference: templates/registration-hero.html

## Tasks
1. Write headline copy
   - **Skill:** /revops-expert (value equation)
   - <verify>Headline uses specific outcome + timeframe</verify>
```

### STATE.md Skill Audit Section

```markdown
## Skill Audit (Current Phase)

| Expected | Invoked | Gap? | Notes |
|----------|---------|------|-------|
| /revops-expert | ✓ | - | Loaded Hormozi stack |
| /frontend-design | ○ | Yes | Used inline CSS instead |

### Gap Analysis
- /frontend-design skipped: Time constraint, used simple markup
- Action: Consider for Phase 2 polish pass
```

### UNIFY Workflow Enhancement

Add to `unify-apply.md`:

```xml
<step name="audit_skill_invocations">
1. Read .paul/SPECIAL-FLOWS.md
2. For each declared skill:
   - Was it invoked this phase? (check conversation/logs)
   - If not: document in Deviations section
3. If patterns changed intentionally:
   - Suggest updating SPECIAL-FLOWS.md
   - Log decision if significant
</step>
```

## Example: Extendly RevOps Project

**SPECIAL-FLOWS.md:**

```markdown
# Specialized Flows

## Project-Level Dependencies

| Work Type | Skill/Command | When Required |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Persuasion copy | /revops-expert | Before headlines, CTAs, offers |
| Offer stacking | /revops-expert:frameworks:hormozi | AOV optimization phases |
| UI components | /frontend-design | Before writing HTML |
| Webinar scripts | /revops-expert:tasks:webinar-script | Webinar content |

## Phase Overrides

| Phase | Additional Skills | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| 4 (AOV) | /revops-expert:frameworks:hormozi | Upsell/downsell stack |
| 5 (Webinar) | /revops-expert:tasks:webinar-script | Full script generation |

## Templates & Assets

| Asset Type | Location | When Used |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| Slide deck | [external] | Content source for all phases |

## Verification Checklist

During UNIFY, confirm:
- [ ] /revops-expert loaded before writing copy
- [ ] Hormozi frameworks applied to offers
- [ ] Gaps documented if skills skipped
```

---

## Implementation Order

1. **Reference** - Write conceptual docs first
2. **Template** - Define SPECIAL-FLOWS.md structure
3. **Workflow** - Build configure-special-flows.md
4. **Command** - Create /paul:flows skill
5. **Init Update** - Add orchestration step to init-project.md
6. **UNIFY Update** - Add skill audit step

---

## Decision to Log

**Category:** PAUL Framework
**Decision:** Implement Specialized Workflow Integration via SPECIAL-FLOWS.md
**Rationale:** Explicit skill documentation enables verification, gap analysis, and continuous improvement of AI-assisted workflows
**Recall:** paul flows, skill integration, special flows, workflow mapping

---

## Open Questions

1. Should skill invocation be tracked automatically (hook-based) or manually verified during UNIFY?
2. Should `/paul:flows audit` warn or block if required skills weren't invoked?
3. How to handle skills that are "recommended" vs "required"?
