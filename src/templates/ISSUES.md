| Substantial | Half day+, definitely needs dedicated plan |

## When to Create

**Create an issue when:**
- During APPLY, you notice something that could be better
- It's not blocking current work
- It's not a bug (bugs get fixed immediately)
- It would be scope creep to address now

**Don't create an issue when:**
- It's a bug (fix it or document as blocker)
- It's required for current AC (do it)
- It's already in the roadmap

---

## Workflow

1. During APPLY, notice enhancement opportunity
2. Log to `.paul/ISSUES.md` with ISS-NNN format
3. Note in SUMMARY.md: "Logged ISS-003 for future consideration"
4. Continue with current plan
5. Review ISSUES.md during phase planning
6. Address issues in appropriate future phase
