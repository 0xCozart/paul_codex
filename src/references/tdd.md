<overview>
TDD is about design quality, not coverage metrics. The red-green-refactor cycle forces you to think about behavior before implementation, producing cleaner interfaces and more testable code.

**Principle:** If you can describe the behavior as `expect(fn(input)).toBe(output)` before writing `fn`, TDD improves the result.

**Key insight:** TDD work is fundamentally heavier than standard tasks—it requires 2-3 execution cycles (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR), each with file reads, test runs, and potential debugging. TDD features get dedicated plans to ensure full context is available throughout the cycle.

## When TDD Improves Quality

**TDD candidates (create a TDD plan with `type: tdd`):**
- Business logic with defined inputs/outputs
- API endpoints with request/response contracts
- Data transformations, parsing, formatting
- Validation rules and constraints
- Algorithms with testable behavior
- State machines and workflows
- Utility functions with clear specifications

**Skip TDD (use standard plan with `type: execute`):**
- UI layout, styling, visual components
- Configuration changes
- Glue code connecting existing components
- One-off scripts and migrations
- Simple CRUD with no business logic
- Exploratory prototyping

**Heuristic:** Can you write `expect(fn(input)).toBe(output)` before writing `fn`?
→ Yes: Create a TDD plan
→ No: Use standard plan, add tests after if needed

<tdd_plan_structure>

## TDD Plan Structure

Each TDD plan implements **one feature** through the full RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle.

```yaml
---
phase: XX-name
plan: NN
type: tdd
---
```

```markdown
## Objective

[What feature and why]
Purpose: [Design benefit of TDD for this feature]
Output: [Working, tested feature]

## Context

@.paul/PROJECT.md
@.paul/ROADMAP.md
@relevant/source/files.ts

## Acceptance Criteria

- AC-1: Failing test written and committed
- AC-2: Implementation passes all tests
- AC-3: Refactor complete (if needed)

## Feature

<feature>
  <name>[Feature name]</name>
  <files>[source file, test file]</files>
  <behavior>
    [Expected behavior in testable terms]
    Cases: input → expected output
  </behavior>
  <implementation>[How to implement once tests pass]</implementation>
</feature>

## Verification

[Test command that proves feature works]

## Boundaries

DO NOT CHANGE: [files outside TDD scope]
```

**One feature per TDD plan.** If features are trivial enough to batch, they're trivial enough to skip TDD.

<execution_flow>

## Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

**RED - Write failing test:**
1. Create test file following project conventions
2. Write test describing expected behavior
3. Run test - it MUST fail
4. If test passes: feature exists or test is wrong. Investigate.
5. Commit: `test({phase}-{plan}): add failing test for [feature]`

**GREEN - Implement to pass:**
1. Write minimal code to make test pass
2. No cleverness, no optimization - just make it work
3. Run test - it MUST pass
4. Commit: `feat({phase}-{plan}): implement [feature]`

**REFACTOR (if needed):**
1. Clean up implementation if obvious improvements exist
2. Run tests - MUST still pass
3. Only commit if changes made: `refactor({phase}-{plan}): clean up [feature]`

**Result:** Each TDD plan produces 2-3 atomic commits.

</execution_flow>

<test_quality>

## Good Tests vs Bad Tests

**Test behavior, not implementation:**
- Good: "returns formatted date string"
- Bad: "calls formatDate helper with correct params"
- Tests should survive refactors

**One concept per test:**
- Good: Separate tests for valid input, empty input, malformed input
- Bad: Single test checking all edge cases with multiple assertions

**Descriptive names:**
- Good: "should reject empty email", "returns null for invalid ID"
- Bad: "test1", "handles error", "works correctly"

**No implementation details:**
- Good: Test public API, observable behavior
- Bad: Mock internals, test private methods, assert on internal state

</test_quality>

<commit_pattern>

## PAUL Commit Pattern for TDD Plans

TDD plans produce 2-3 atomic commits (one per phase):

```
test(08-02): add failing test for email validation

- Tests valid email formats accepted
- Tests invalid formats rejected
- Tests empty input handling

feat(08-02): implement email validation

- Regex pattern matches RFC 5322
- Returns boolean for validity
- Handles edge cases (empty, null)

refactor(08-02): extract regex to constant (optional)

- Moved pattern to EMAIL_REGEX constant
- No behavior changes
- Tests still pass
```

**Format:** `{type}({phase}-{plan}): {description}`

Types for TDD:
- `test` - RED phase (failing test)
- `feat` - GREEN phase (implementation)
- `refactor` - REFACTOR phase (cleanup)

</commit_pattern>

<context_budget>

## Context Budget

TDD plans target **~40% context usage** (lower than standard plans' ~50%).

Why lower:
- RED phase: write test, run test, potentially debug why it didn't fail
- GREEN phase: implement, run test, potentially iterate on failures
- REFACTOR phase: modify code, run tests, verify no regressions

Each phase involves reading files, running commands, analyzing output. The back-and-forth is inherently heavier than linear task execution.

Single feature focus ensures full quality throughout the cycle.

<error_handling>

## Error Handling

**Test doesn't fail in RED phase:**
- Feature may already exist - investigate
- Test may be wrong (not testing what you think)
- Fix before proceeding

**Test doesn't pass in GREEN phase:**
- Debug implementation
- Don't skip to refactor
- Keep iterating until green

**Tests fail in REFACTOR phase:**
- Undo refactor
- Commit was premature
- Refactor in smaller steps

**Unrelated tests break:**
- Stop and investigate
- May indicate coupling issue
- Fix before proceeding
